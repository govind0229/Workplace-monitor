# Changelog

All notable changes to WorkplaceMonitor will be documented in this file.

## [2.0.4] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- **Native CI Compilation** — Transitioned from a single generic runner to dedicated hardware runners in the build pipeline (`macos-13` for Intel and `macos-14` for ARM). This ensures that native Node.js dependencies (e.g., `better-sqlite3`) are compiled natively for their target architectures, permanently resolving `dlopen` incompatible architecture errors on Intel machines.

## [2.0.3] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- **MacOS Installer Relocation** — Fixed an issue where Apple's `PackageKit` would automatically relocate the app installation to existing development builds instead of strictly installing to `/Applications`. Disabled the `BundleIsRelocatable` flag during `.pkg` compilation to ensure strict installation paths and resolve Homebrew installation failures.

## [2.0.2] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- **Polished Professional Installer** — Re-enabled the distribution-style installer using `productbuild`. Users now experience a standard, branded macOS installation interface with a streamlined license and component selection process.

### Improved
- **Distribution Script Architecture** — Updated `build_distribution_pkg.sh` to support multi-architecture workflows, allowing the creation of distinct, polished installers for both Intel and Apple Silicon.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- **Version Bumping Script** — Fixed a bug in `bump_version.sh` that accidentally overwrote the XML declaration version in `distribution.xml`. The script now correctly targets only the application version within the `pkg-ref` tags.
- **Homebrew Cask Syntax** — Standardized the multi-architecture Cask syntax to use the preferred `sha256 arm: ..., intel: ...` format for cleaner architecture-specific verification.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- **Architecture-Optimized Packages** — The build pipeline now produces separate, optimized `.pkg` installers for Intel/AMD (`x64`) and Apple Silicon (`arm64`). This ensures the smallest possible footprint for each architecture (~50MB vs ~250MB for a universal bundle).
- **Smart Multi-Arch Homebrew Cask** — Overhauled the Homebrew tap logic. The `workinghours` Cask now dynamically detects the host architecture and automatically fetches the correct package.
- **Legacy macOS Support (v11.0+)** — Standardized the deployment target to **macOS 11.0 (Big Sur)** across all native components (Swift utility and Node.js), ensuring robust support for older hardware.
- **Matrix-Powered Build Pipeline** — Migrated to a dual-stage GitHub Actions architecture with matrix builds for parallel compilation, improving release speed and reliability.

### Improved
- **Download Efficiency** — By providing split packages instead of a universal binary, users now download 80% less data during installation and updates.
- **Build Script Robustness** — Updated `download_node.sh` and `build_pkg.sh` with architecture-aware logic and explicit target-triplet compilation.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-04-09
 
### Added
- **Native Geofencing (Region Monitoring)** — Migrated office detection from high-power GPS polling to hardware-level region monitoring. The macOS location co-processor now handles boundary detection, allowing the main GPS hardware to sleep 99% of the time.
- **GPS Self-Hibernation** — Implemented an intelligent power manager that automatically deactivates GPS once a stable location is acquired or when the dashboard is closed, saving significant battery.
- **Adaptive Polling Hints** — The Node.js server now provides dynamic polling "hints" (`suggested_poll_ms`). The native client automatically slows its synchronization from 5s to 20s when the system is idle or the user is home.
- **Screen-Lock UI Hibernation** — The menu bar refresh and UI timers are now completely suspended when the screen is locked, eliminating background CPU wake-ups during inactivity.
 
### Fixed
- **Dashboard Geolocation Hang** — Resolved a critical UI freeze in `WKWebView` by migrating the "Set Office Location" feature to the native Swift location bridge.
- **Notification Payload Mismatch** — Fixed an issue where native notifications failed to display due to a payload key discrepancy between the server and the native client.
 
### Improved
- **Extreme Energy Reduction** — Removed seconds from the menu bar UI, allowing the refresh interval to be slowed from 1s to 60s (a 60x reduction in UI-related wake-ups).
- **Location Hardware Optimization** — Increased `distanceFilter` to 30m and tuned `desiredAccuracy` to prioritize cell/WiFi triangulation over GPS when precision is not required.

## [1.5.2] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- **Active Call Detection (Teams/Zoom/Meet Support)** — Integrated hardware-level monitoring via `AVFoundation`. The app can now detect if the Microphone or Camera is active and will **bypass the 5-minute idle-pause** during these calls. Resolves the issue of timers pausing during long meetings.
- **Microphone & Camera Usage Metadata** — Added required usage descriptions to `Info.plist` to comply with macOS security standards for hardware-state observation.

### Improved
- **Geofence-aware UI Optimization** — The "Route to Office" card now intelligently simplifies its display when the user is inside the geofence boundary. It automatically hides the commuting distance and ETA, showing only the "✓ Inside Geofence" status.
- **Resource Efficiency** — Suppressed unnecessary road-route and ETA calculations while inside the geofence to save battery and reduce network bandwidth.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- **Native Geolocation Bridge** — Implemented a `WKScriptMessageHandler` bridge between macOS and the dashboard. This bypasses `WKWebView` permission restrictions by retrieving GPS data natively via Swift and "feeding" it directly into the map. Resolves "Location access denied" errors inside the app.
- **Hardened Runtime Entitlements** — Introduced a dedicated `.entitlements` configuration. The application is now signed with explicit `personal-information.location` authorization, ensuring macOS trusts the binary to handle GPS data.

### Fixed
- **Swift Compilation Errors** — Resolved redundant delegate conformance and handled macOS-specific `CLAuthorizationStatus` constants to ensure stable builds on macOS 12+.
- **Identifier Synchronization** — Completed the full migration from `com.user.workinghours` to `com.workplacemonitor.app` across all native codebases and LaunchAgent logic.

### Improved
- **Dashboard UI Optimization** — Streamlined the **"Route to Office"** card by removing redundant "Road route unavailable" and "(showing straight-line only)" labels. The UI now collapses gracefully when data is missing, maintaining a clean, professional aesthetic.
- **Visual Hierarchy** — Bolder typography and an elegant glow effect added to the distance metrics for a more premium "state-of-the-art" dashboard feel.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- **Workplace Monitor Branding** — Officially renamed the application to **"Workplace Monitor"** consistently across the UI, installer, and metadata to align with the project identity.
- **Interactive Map Route Labels** — High-fidelity distance labels now appear directly on the map route line (e.g., "1.2 km drive"). Features a modern glassmorphism design that adapts to dark/light themes.
- **Routing Reliability Fallback** — Implemented a primary/backup OSRM server architecture. If the primary routing engine is congested, the app automatically switches to a backup to ensure road distances are calculated.
- **Robust Geolocation Fallback** — Added an automatic "Standard Accuracy" fallback for GPS. If a high-precision fix fails (indoors or poor signal), the app now retries with WiFi/Cell triangulation to prevent timeout errors.

### Fixed
- **Distance UI Reset Bug** — Fixed a critical issue where the main distance display would reset to "— km" if a road-route calculation failed. It now gracefully retains the straight-line distance as a fallback.
- **Geolocation Timeouts** — Significantly increased the GPS acquisition timeout (from 10s back to 30s) to improve reliability in dense urban environments or building interiors.
- **Dashboard Script Errors** — Cleaned up duplicate script tags and refined the frontend auto-refresh logic for smoother map updates.

### Refactored
- **Version Management Script** — Completely overhauled `bump_version.sh` to support robust, multi-line regex replacements across `Info.plist`, `distribution.xml`, and metadata files.
- **Distance Card Logic** — Streamlined `updateDistanceCard` and `calculateRoute` interaction to be more reactive and prevent race conditions during location updates.


## [1.4.1] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- **Centralized Versioning** — Introduced a single `.version` file as the source of truth for all build scripts, GitHub Actions, and packaging. Added a `bump_version.sh` utility to sync HTML and JSON files effortlessly.

### Fixed
- **History View Statistics UI Bug** — Fixed a race condition where the advanced statistics chart in the History view failed to render or appeared completely blank on the first click. Correctly deferred DOM layout computation to ensure the animation and SVG boundaries are generated cleanly.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-29

### Added
- **Website-Level Tracking** — When a browser (Chrome, Safari, Arc, Brave, Edge, Firefox) is the active application, the app now reads the **active tab URL** via AppleScript and tracks the domain name (e.g., `github.com`, `youtube.com`) instead of just the browser name. Requires Automation permission on first launch.
- **Project-Based Time Tracking** — New `projects` system allows creating named, color-coded projects. Sessions can be assigned to a project via the Dashboard dropdown. Full CRUD management in Settings, plus a `GET /project-report` API for per-project time summaries.
- **Cloud Sync** — Background sync worker runs every 5 minutes, batching completed sessions and app usage data into a JSON payload and POSTing it to a configurable remote API with Bearer token authentication. New Settings section to configure Cloud URL, API Key, enable/disable sync, and trigger manual sync.
- **Domain Category Mappings** — Extended the default app category map with 30+ popular website domains automatically categorized (e.g., `github.com` → Productivity, `youtube.com` → Entertainment, `slack.com` → Communication).

### Changed
- **`/start` endpoint** — Now accepts an optional `project_id` in the request body to assign the session to a project.
- **Info.plist** — Added `NSAppleEventsUsageDescription` for browser automation permission.

### Database
- New `projects` table (`id`, `name`, `color`, `created_at`).
- New `sync_log` table for tracking cloud sync watermarks per table.
- Migration: `sessions.project_id` foreign key column added automatically on startup.

## [1.3.7] - 2026-03-19

### Performance
- **Pre-compiled DB statements** — Hot-path SQLite `UPDATE` queries in the background loop are now pre-compiled at startup, eliminating query re-parsing every 5 seconds.
- **Settings cache (30s TTL)** — Goal and break settings are now cached for 30 seconds, reducing 4 DB reads per background tick to zero. Cache is immediately invalidated when settings are saved.
- **Removed double DB query in background loop** — Both session types are now fetched upfront in a single pass, instead of calling `getActiveSession()` twice for the manual session.
- **Status interpolation cap corrected** — Live time interpolation in `/status` was still using a 300-second cap (bug), now correctly using 30s, consistent with the background loop.
- **Removed dead code from `/status`** — Cleaned up an empty `isAtOffice` block that ran on every status request with no effect.
- **Optimized URLSession (Swift)** — `fetchStatus()` now uses a pre-configured `URLSession` with `ephemeral` config, 3s timeout, and a single persistent connection to localhost, reducing connection overhead on 2-second polling.

### Fixed
- **Widget timer lag** — `uiTimer` now renders at 0.25s intervals (4× per second) for smooth display. Server `pollTimer` reduced to 2s and is fully decoupled from rendering — no more stutter from double `updateUI()` calls.
- **Session start/stop notifications not received** — Added missing `🏠 WFH Session Started` notification on screen unlock, `🏠 WFH Session Paused` on screen lock, and improved manual session notification titles to `🏢 Workplace Session Started` and `✅ Finish Day Session`.

## [1.3.6] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- **Tracery Grammar-Powered Break Notifications** — Replaced the static break message pool with [tracery-grammar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tracery-grammar), a combinatorial natural-language generator. Each break now generates a fresh, uniquely worded message by randomly combining grammar rules (verbs, durations, benefits, context phrases). Produces thousands of unique combinations per time slot — fully offline, no AI or API required.

### Fixed
- **WFH Timer Running Overnight** — Root cause fixed: automatic WFH sessions now start with `status = 'paused'` instead of `active`. The timer only starts counting when a genuine screen-unlock event is received, preventing overnight accumulation.
- **Startup Screen-State Sync** — `mac_utility.swift` now sends an initial `lock` or `unlock` event to the server 4 seconds after launch, ensuring the server's session state matches the actual screen lock state at startup.

## [1.3.5] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- **Smart Time-Aware Break Notifications** — Break reminders are now contextually intelligent. The app selects the most appropriate message based on the current time of day:
  - **Morning (7–11am):** Hydration, goal-setting, posture, and energy tips.
  - **Lunch (11am–1:30pm):** Lunch break, step-outside, and social connection reminders.
  - **Afternoon (1:30–4pm):** Energy dip, 20-20-20 eye rule, snack, and focus reset prompts.
  - **Late Afternoon (4–6pm):** Wind-down, end-of-day review, and final hydration reminders.
  - **Evening (6pm+):** Disconnect, reduce screen brightness, and dinner reminders.
- **Non-Repeating Messages** — A `suggestion_history` database table tracks all sent break messages. The app will never repeat the same message within a **7-day window**.

### Fixed
- **WFH Timer Overcount on Screen Lock** — The background timer delta cap was reduced from 300s to 30s, preventing large time jumps when the machine wakes from sleep and the lock event was missed.
- **Orphaned Sessions from Previous Days** — On startup, any sessions from previous dates that were accidentally left in `active` or `paused` state are now automatically marked as `completed`.

## [1.3.4] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- **Native macOS Architecture** — Migrated to a true native entry point where `mac_utility` (Swift) acts as the primary executable, significantly improving system stability and resolving "damaged bundle" false-positives.
- **Internal Backend Spawning** — The Swift application now automatically spawns and manages the Node.js server lifecycle internally.
- **Auto-Persistence** — Integrated seamless LaunchAgent registration within the Swift binary for automatic startup out-of-the-box.
- **Enhanced Polling Frequency** — Notification check interval increased to 1 second for near-instant system alerts on session start/stop.

### Fixed
- **Notification Reliability** — Fixed a "queue theft" bug where the web dashboard would clear the server-side notification queue before the native macOS app could display the banners.
- **Bundle Integrity** — Corrected `Info.plist` and directory structures to align with strict macOS Application Bundle standards, fixing permission errors.
- **Start/Stop Attribution** — Guaranteed 100% native system attribution for "Start Workplace", "Finish Day", and "Goal Achieved" notifications.

## [1.3.3] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **WFH Break Notifications** — Added customizable break reminders specifically for work-from-home sessions.
- **Location Arrival Notifications** — Added native notifications when arriving at the configured office location.
- **Goal Completion Notifications** — Restored native notifications for daily goal completion.

### Fixed
- **Notification Crash** — Replaced direct macOS Swift `UNUserNotificationCenter` calls with `node-notifier` to fix a silent crash on first launch outside of the App bundle.
- **macOS App Nap** — Fixed an issue where macOS throttled the background timers when the app window was hidden, leading to lost time. Background compensation cap was increased to ensure timers tick accurately.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **Premium Location Page Design** — New immersive split-screen layout with high-end glassmorphic controls and centered panels.
- **Interactive Radius Gauge** — Dynamic SVG-based gauge that provides real-time visual feedback for the geofence boundary.
- **Custom Precision Slider** — Bespoke range slider with interactive -/+ buttons for precise radius adjustments.
- **Map Type Switcher** — New floating control to toggle between Dark Matter, Positron, Street, and Satellite map styles (Street view now default).
- **High-Fidelity Office Marker** — Premium custom purple pin with a pulsing base glow and professional HUD-style location labels.
- **Refined Geofence Visuals** — Dual-circle geofences with high-contrast borders for better definition against dark and satellite maps.
- **Geofence Auto-Save** — Geofence radius changes are now automatically synchronized with the server via debounced auto-save logic.

### Fixed
- **Location Permission Prompts** — Fixed an issue where the app would stop asking for location permissions; the request is now triggered proactively on page load.

<!-- ## [1.3.1] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Native macOS Notifications** — Goal completion alerts now use native macOS `UserNotifications` for a premium system experience, including standard banner styles, system sounds, and Notification Center persistence.
- **Notification Permissions** — The app now properly requests user permission for notifications upon first launch.

### Changed
- **Enhanced Status API** — The backend `/status` endpoint now exposes goal settings and notification state to the native Swift utility.
- **Unified Notification Logic** — Moved notification triggers from Node.js to Swift to ensure native appearance and behavior. -->

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added
- **GPS Location Automation** — Automatically start the Workplace timer when arriving at the office and finish it when leaving, using native macOS `CoreLocation` geofencing.
- **Interactive Map View** — New dedicated "Location" page in the sidebar with a Leaflet-powered interactive map showing the office geofence radius and your current position.
- **Set Office Location** — One-click button to capture your current GPS coordinates as the office location using the browser's Geolocation API.
- **Configurable Geofence Radius** — Adjustable radius (50–2000m) for defining the office boundary.
- **Clear Office Location** — Button to disable location automation and clear saved coordinates.
- **Stale Session Recovery** — Server automatically completes orphaned manual sessions on startup if they've been idle for more than 30 minutes (safety net for missed location updates).
- **Location Info Cards** — Dashboard cards showing Office Coordinates, Geofence Radius, and monitoring Status.
- **README Screenshots** — Added screenshots of Dashboard, Location, History, and Settings views.

### Changed
- **start.sh Rewrite** — Development script now builds a minimal `.app` bundle so macOS properly grants Location permissions during development.
- **kill_server.sh** — Now also terminates the dev `.app` bundle and `mac_utility` processes.
- **Info.plist** — Added `NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription`, `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription`, and `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription` keys.
- **Database Migrations** — Added automatic column migrations for `type`, `notified`, and `last_break_notify` in the sessions table to support older databases.
- **Timer Completion** — Office timer now properly finishes (completes the session) instead of pausing when leaving the geofence.

## [1.2.3] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- **Mac Widget Dynamic Icons** — The macOS menu bar widget now dynamically displays an outline of the office icon and workplace timer when working in the office, and automatically switches back to the home icon and daily timer otherwise.
- **Dynamic Session Icons** — The active tracking logo now visually switches between "Office" and "Home" (WFH) depending on whether the manual session is running.
- **Combined Daily Chart Label** — The top label of the "Last 7 Days" chart columns now shows the combined total duration of both Workplace and WFH hours instead of just the higher of the two.

### Changed
- **WFH Priority** — Automatically pausing the background "WFH" tracker while a manual "Workplace" session is actively running so both timers don't overlap simultaneously.
- **Terminology Updates** — Renamed all user-facing instances of "Day Working" and "Day Total" to "WFH" (Work From Home) for clearer distinction.
- **Simplified Chart Legends** — Removed unnecessary color dots from the "Last 7 Days" chart legend and removed the goal dot helper icon for a cleaner interface.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- **New Accent Colors** — Added three stunning new high-contrast accent colors specifically tailored for Light Theme: Indigo, Teal, and Coral.
- **Dynamic Structural Colors** — Re-engineered `app.js` to intelligently compute proper rgba overlays and shadows dynamically based on the chosen Accent Color.
- **Cache Invalidations** — Added logic to forcefully purge Apple's `WKWebsiteDataStore` disk caching, ensuring CSS style updates are immediately seen on launch.
- Added Gatekeeper troubleshooting instructions for Gatekeeper quarantine flag (`xattr -cr`) bypass.

### Fixed
- **Light Theme Color Bleed** — Fixed an issue where the Light Theme forcefully overrode custom accent colors with static visual purple.
- **Invisible Color Swatches** — Fixed an issue where the color selection swatches in the Settings menu rendered visually invisible as default white pills in WKWebView due to missing CSS classes.
